## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart
### üì• Install
```shell
pip install pixelateme
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run
After installation, pip registers a shortcut binary which can be called (on windows for example) like this:
```shell
pixelateme --mode blur FOLDER_OR_FILES
```
This will create a new ```pixelated``` folder, where all the pixelated files are stored.

## üéØ Features
- Different anonymization modes: pixelate, blur and color
- GPU acceleration
- Preview of current processed files
- Face Recognition to only blur specific faces or to blur all faces except specific ones
- ONNXRT and OpenCV runtime backend

## üíª CLI Arguments
* ```--suffix```: Filename suffix of processed files. Default: 
* ```--output``` (-o): Output directory for processed files. Default: ./pixelated
* ```--mode``` (-m): Mode of anonymization. Default: pixelate
* ```--threshold``` (-t): Threshold for detected faces (higher means more confidence). Default: 0.5
* ```--backend```: Desired backend (e.g. opencv or onnxrt). Auto prefers onnxrt and falls back to opencv. Default: auto
* ```--only-blur-this-faces```: Folder containing images of faces (one face per image), which should be considered for anonymization. All other faces won't be anonymized. Default: None
* ```--blur-except-this-faces```: Folder containing images of faces (one face per image), which should be ignored for anonymization. Default: None
* ```--ellipse```: Uses ellipses as form for anonymization. Default is rectangle
* ```--blur-strength```: Defines how "blurry" a face will be. Only working with ```--mode``` "blur". Default: 3
* ```--pixelate-size```: Size of pixelation effect. The higher the value, the harder it is to recognize the face. Default: 16
* ```--deepface-similarity```: Maximum similarity between two faces. Higher value means, that more faces are considered as equal. Only working in combination with ```--blur-except-this-faces``` or ```--only-blur-this-faces```. Default: 0.4
* ```--preview```: Enable preview of the currently processed image. No preview is default
* ```--face-recognition-size```: Image size to use for face recognition. Format: WxH (e.g. 720x480). Default: None
* ```--maximum-face-recognition-size```: Maximum number of pixels of the longest side for face recognition. Images larger than this will be downscaled for face recognition. This doesn't affect output resolution. Default: 640
